scan_u32b();
scan_u64b();

scan_u*b() invokes undefined behaviour when working on sizeof(type) * CHAR_BIT.
In other words, if sizeof(long) * CHAR_BIT == 64, scan_ulongb() will invoke
undefined behaviour when processing the last bit.

The current method of using HAVE_LONGLONG in header files is insufficient.
If the library is compiled with compiler X, which supports long long and
a user compiles code using compiler Y, which doesn't support long long, against
the binaries and header files produced with compiler X, the compilation will
fail.

Header files should only import other public header files, not private ones.

iarray_sort() needs more automated testing.
