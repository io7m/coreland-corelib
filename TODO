scan_u*b() invokes undefined behaviour when working on sizeof(type) * CHAR_BIT.
In other words, if sizeof(long) * CHAR_BIT == 64, scan_ulongb() will invoke
undefined behaviour when processing the last bit.

fmt_double() invokes undefined behaviour if the current system does not provide
the long long type and long is 32 bits.

Header files should only import other public header files, not private ones.

iarray_sort() needs more automated testing.
