Audit inter-dependencies.

Add non fixed-size fmt, non fixed-size scan,

Possibly, given that compatibility with older versions is a non-issue,
the current fmt.h should be moved to fmt_spec.h or something similar
to denote that fmt.h is now for flexible sizes and the old fmt_spec.h
is for specific size integers.

The same should be done for scan.h

Document dir_hash, base_name, dir_name.
Document signal.

Change documentation for buffer (no uint32).
Change documentation for str.h (str_ndiff, str_same is now a macro etc)

bin_dup from urlparse.

fmt_float
fmt_double
