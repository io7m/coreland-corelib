fmt_float()
fmt_double()

iarray_sort() incorrectly handles unused nodes (it should always make
sure that unused nodes are pushed to the end of the list, for performance
reasons. currently, data is sorted incorrectly, or unused nodes appear
at the start of the list, trashing performance on huge lists).
