20060224 code: darwin and sunOS compatibility (makelib, makeso)
20060226 code: fmt added (no tests yet)
20060226 code: dstring tests added, but dstring_chop needs examining;
               should it take a numeric index or a 'length' as an
               argument? potential for dangerous off-by-one errors.
20060226 code: fmt tests added
20060228 code: fd added (no tests)
20060228 code: fd tests added

20060228 code: uint tests added
20060228 code: int added with tests
20060228 code: nonblock added (it's not clear how to test this)
20060301 code: open added (no tests)
20060301 code: open tests added
20060301 code: scan added (no tests)
20060301 code: floats and endian sysdeps added as dependencies (no tests)
20060301 code: float tests added
20060301 code: scan tests added. Planning to add non-specific sized
               scan_float and scan_double functions due to the number of
               varying float implementations. Also plan to seperate
               the scan_float functions into their own header file as
               some machines may not have 32 bit and 64 bit floats.
20060301 code: seperated scan.h and scan_float.h (tests updated)
20060302 code: added scan_float and scan_double with test
20060302 code: seek added (no tests)
20060302 code: seek tests added
20060302 code: sstring added (no tests)

20060303 code: sgetline added (no tests)
20060303 code: basic sgetline test added
20060303 code: bug fix in ht_destroy
20060303 code: sunOS + darwin compatibility (passed all tests)
20060303 code: alloc now uses void *, not char *
20060304 code: another bug fix in ht_destroy thanks to electric fence!
20060312 code: UNIT_TESTS makefile now cleans up tools
20060312 code: added stalloc
20060312 code: added stalloc tests
20060312 code: static allocator is now no longer the default. alloc
               calls calloc() by default. there is also no longer any
               need for allocmalloc, so it is being removed.
20060319 version: corelib-0.01 (first public release)
20060319 code: corrected CFLAGS
20060319 version: corelib-0.011
20060320 code: cleaned up buffer_get and buffer_put function pointers
20060320 code: general compiler warning squashes. casts.
20060321 code: sys_err now takes const char * strings instead of char *.
20060324 code: added array_data()
20060325 code: hashtable.h HASH_BUCKETS == 2048 like the documentation
               says!
20060329 code: minor style nit in sstring_trunc.c
20060330 doc: LICENSE added
20060422 code: dstring rewritten to avoid leaks. slight changes to
               interface and behaviour. updated tests.
20060422 code: sys_err renamed to syserr.
20060422 note: now totally incompatible with corelib-0.1.
20060422 version: corelib-0.2
20060428 code: moved SYS_DEPS to SYSDEPS for upcoming coreproject
               updates.
20060428 version: corelib-0.3 (no release)
20060501 code: array_init no longer returns 2 if the array is allocated.
               if it ever really becomes necessary to check if an array
               is allocated in the future, there'll be an
               array_allocated() macro.
20060501 code: updated to latest sysdeps.
20060501 code: array_trunc is now equivalent to array_chop(a, 0);
               trying to make things a little more unified.
