20060220 code: alloc test updated
20060220 code: bin test

20060220 code: buffer added (added error and str as dependencies)
20060222 code: str tests
20060222 code: closeonexec added
20060222 code: close added
20060222 code: dstring added (no tests yet)
20060222 code: direntry added (sysdep)
20060224 code: darwin and sunOS compatibility (makelib, makeso)
20060226 code: fmt added (no tests yet)
20060226 code: dstring tests added, but dstring_chop needs examining;
               should it take a numeric index or a 'length' as an
               argument? potential for dangerous off-by-one errors.
20060226 code: fmt tests added
20060228 code: fd added (no tests)
20060228 code: fd tests added
20060228 code: added missing array_copy function and tested

20060301 code: open added (no tests)
20060301 code: open tests added
20060301 code: scan added (no tests)
20060301 code: floats and endian sysdeps added as dependencies (no tests)
20060301 code: float tests added
20060301 code: scan tests added. Planning to add non-specific sized
               scan_float and scan_double functions due to the number of
               varying float implementations. Also plan to seperate
               the scan_float functions into their own header file as
               some machines may not have 32 bit and 64 bit floats.
20060301 code: seperated scan.h and scan_float.h (tests updated)
20060302 code: added scan_float and scan_double with test
20060302 code: seek added (no tests)
20060302 code: seek tests added
20060302 code: sstring added (no tests)

20060303 code: bug fix in ht_destroy
20060303 code: sunOS + darwin compatibility (passed all tests)
20060303 code: alloc now uses void *, not char *
20060304 code: another bug fix in ht_destroy thanks to electric fence!
20060312 code: UNIT_TESTS makefile now cleans up tools
20060312 code: added stalloc
20060312 code: added stalloc tests
20060312 code: static allocator is now no longer the default. alloc
               calls calloc() by default. there is also no longer any
               need for allocmalloc, so it is being removed.
20060319 version: corelib-0.01 (first public release)
20060319 code: corrected CFLAGS
20060319 version: corelib-0.011
20060320 code: cleaned up buffer_get and buffer_put function pointers
20060320 code: general compiler warning squashes. casts.
20060321 code: sys_err now takes const char * strings instead of char *.
20060324 code: added array_data()
20060325 code: hashtable.h HASH_BUCKETS == 2048 like the documentation
               says!
20060329 code: minor style nit in sstring_trunc.c
20060330 doc: LICENSE added
20060422 code: dstring rewritten to avoid leaks. slight changes to
               interface and behaviour. updated tests.
20060422 code: sys_err renamed to syserr.
20060422 note: now totally incompatible with corelib-0.1.
20060422 version: corelib-0.2
20060428 code: moved SYS_DEPS to SYSDEPS for upcoming coreproject
               updates.
20060428 version: corelib-0.3 (no release)
20060501 code: array_init no longer returns 2 if the array is allocated.
               if it ever really becomes necessary to check if an array
               is allocated in the future, there'll be an
               array_allocated() macro.
20060501 code: updated to latest sysdeps.
20060501 code: array_trunc is now equivalent to array_chop(a, 0);
               trying to make things a little more unified.
20060502 code: renamed makefile-local to Mkfile-local and restructured
               slightly due to cpj-genmk updates.

20060507 code: updated to cpj-genmk-0.6
20060507 code: added sysmath-libs and conf-ldfflist

20060510 code: updated to cpj-genmk-0.7
20060510 code: updated to latest sysdeps
20060523 code: buffer no longer uses uint32, but uses unsigned int.
               this may break binary compatibility, but this is no
               problem as corelib is currently totally incompatible
               with earlier versions anyway.
20060523 code: buffer_copy and test.
20060523 code: changed dir_array so that it no longer relies on uint32.
20060523 code: added dir_hash and test.
20060523 code: added dir_name, base_name and tests.
20060524 code: added str_ndiff and changed str_same, str_nsame to
               macros.
20060524 code: fixed t_base_name and t_dir_name tests for the above.
20060524 code: added env and tests.
20060526 code: large changes to fmt and scan.
               fmt and scan functions that operate on specific sized
               integers have been moved into fmt_spec.h and scan_spec.h
               respectively. fmt and scan functions that operate on
               specific sized floats have been moved into fmt_fspec.h
               and scan_fspec.h respectively. fmt and scan now use
               standard C integers by default.
20060526 version: corelib-0.33 (no release)

20060604 code: corelib-config
20060608 code: updated to new installer and deinstaller
20060608 code: test adjustments for base_name and dir_name

20060612 code: parameters reordered in some of the older APIs for
               uniformity.
20060614 code: portability updates for OS X
20060614 code: updated sysdeps
20060620 code: updated sysdeps
20060620 code: linux-ppc fix for t_get_opt

20060705 code: header format change from sysdeps
20060705 code: darwin libname compat
20060705 version: corelib-0.40
20060706 code: hpux -> hp-ux in sysdep-subs.
20060709 code: fd_dup now uses the atomic fd_dup2 if available.
20060718 code: bin_same now a macro.
20060718 code: bin_diff interface changed to match str_diff (why was
               this not done before?).
20060718 code: bin_char and bin_rchar added with tests.
20060718 code: sgetline_get now uses bin_char instead of bin_chr.
20060718 code: sgetline_get now returns blank lines instead of skipping.
20060718 code: str_char and str_rchar added with tests.
20060719 code: dstring and sstring now use unsigned long. this change
               was made on 20060627 but apparently somehow didn't make
               it into the commit.
20060719 code: installer update.
20060719 note: previous version withdrawn!
20060719 version: corelib-0.41

20060827 code: fd_dup return statement inside #ifdef as opposed to
               outside.
20060915 code: added str_casei* (case insensitive string comparison)
               and updated tests.
               new coreproject tools and makefile.
20060916 version: corelib-0.42 (no release)

20061007 code: missing header files in insthier
20061003 version: corelib-0.431
20061013 code: endian.h and signal.h conflict with standard C library
               on linux. renamed to sig.h and byteorder.h
20061013 version: corelib-0.44
20061019 code: Mkf-local gone. new coreproject tools.

20061028 code: obsolete uint8.h removed.
20061028 version: corelib-0.441
20061029 code: no longer install symlinks to static libraries, this is
               to work around some more stupid Darwin misbehaviour.
20061109 code: FMT_ULONG == (sizeof(long) >> 1).
20061109 code: array no longer uses specific sized integers.

               FMT_ULONGLONG == ((sizeof(long long) >> 1) * 8).
20061111 code: stalloc now gets the parameters in the right order (this could
               cause crashes on linux, other platforms seemed not to be
               affected).
20061111 code: corelib-conf no longer prints raw include dir, so the
               only valid #include statements are of the form <corelib/*.h>
20061125 code: removal of all superfluous typedefs. buffer is now
               struct buffer. sstring is now struct sstring. etc. this
               is because of various compiler, aesthetic, stylistic and
               whimsical issues.
20061125 code: iarray added.
20061126 version: corelib 0.5

               a power of two, this is not a problem).
20070119 code: test cleanups.
20070208 code: fixed bug in hashtable that would select the wrong key
               if two strings in the same slot shared a common prefix
               equal in length to the smaller string.
20070208 code: new cpj tools.
20070225 code: new installer.
20070225 code: libs-math, new sysdeps.

               bug.
20070228 code: added sd-longlong sysdep. added HAVE_LONGLONG test to
               fmt and scan headers for better C90 compatibility.
20070228 code: added uint.
20070313 code: fixed uint...
20070320 code: iarray_sort and improved iarray tests.
20070322 code: fmt_float fmt_double
