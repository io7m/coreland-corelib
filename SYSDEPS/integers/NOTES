integers

This module creates the appropriate typedef for the integers
header files.

It runs six programs that each write a header file to standard
out with the appropriate typedef for each specific-size integer.

It writes six lines to sysdeps.out:

  int16: declaration needed for 16 bit signed integer
  int32: declaration needed for 32 bit signed integer
  int64: declaration needed for 64 bit signed integer
  uint16: declaration needed for 16 bit unsigned integer
  uint32: declaration needed for 32 bit unsigned integer
  uint64: declaration needed for 64 bit unsigned integer
