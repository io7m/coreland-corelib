NOTES

  t_dir_array will fail when using a copy checked out from svn due to
  the '.svn' directory creating an extra entry in the parent directory.

  t_dir_walk will fail for the same reasons.

  t_fmt_float is known to fail with GCC 3.4.* when
  using high optimization levels. This is due to loss of floating point
  precision when using these optimizations which in turn cause the tests
  to produce slightly incorrect values.
