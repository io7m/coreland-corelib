This library is developed with the intention of aiding the development
of small, efficient, portable and secure software. It is aimed at POSIX
compliant platforms but the majority of the library is platform
independent.
<p/>
It is written to compile with any ISO C90 compiler, but will use C99
features if they are available.
<p/>
Please note that the API is not expected to remain stable until a 1.0
release.
